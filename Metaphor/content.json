When Indian security agencies approached their Canadian counterparts post-2014 with information about Khalistanis taking shelter in their country, Ottawa said that they could not receive intelligence from India as there was no institutionalized mechanism and that intelligence was not evidence. In line with FBI-RCMP protocol, the Indian NIA signed an MoU with RCMP in 2020 but nothing changed as the Justin Trudeau government continued to provide safe haven to Khalistanis for vote bank politics. The relations between India and Canada have been strained with Trudeau's unsubstantiated allegation against India in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. Recent revelations by Indian intelligence have brought to light concerns over the presence of a Khalistan terror network operating in Canada. The dossier, provided by Indian authorities, identifies several Canadian nationals purportedly linked to the proscribed International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) and the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF). Khalistan terror in Canada: How Nijjar weaponized Khalistan, Trudeau looked the other way Gurjit Singh Cheema According to Indian intelligence, Gurjit Singh Cheema, a 50-year-old Canadian national originally from Punjab, is an ISYF/KLF member actively associated with the 'Singh Khalsa Sewa Club' in Toronto. Cheema currently resides in Brampton, Ontario, and works as a truck driver. Cheema's visit to India in 2017 is said to have been for the purpose of operationalizing a module. Upon his arrival in India, he is alleged to have motivated and radicalized Gurpreet Singh Brar and Sukhmanpreet Singh. The dossier also reveals that Cheema lured Sarabjit Singh to join the module. Cheema is also accused of procuring locally-made pistols and funds for module members in Punjab, which were purportedly used for carrying out terrorist activities. In May 2017, with the assistance of Pakistan-based Lakhvir Singh Rode and the late Harmeet Singh, alias PhD, a KLF operative, Cheema is alleged to have sourced a weapon consignment from across the border for ISYF module members. Khalistan terror in Canada: KTF terrorist Arshdeep Dala has a killer record bigger than Nijjar Gurjinder Singh Pannu Gurjinder Singh Pannu, a 28-year-old Canadian national, is another individual mentioned in the intelligence dossier. Pannu currently resides in East Hamilton, Ontario, and is an ISYF/KLF activist actively associated with the 'Singh Khalsa Sewa Club' in Toronto. According to the dossier, Pannu is alleged to have provided funds to ISYF module members in India in March 2017 for purchasing locally-made weapons and operationalizing their activities. He is also accused of sending funds to an individual named Balkar Singh in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, to facilitate the delivery of locally-made weapons to module members in India. Pannu, like Gurjit Singh Cheema, is also alleged to have played a role in sourcing a weapon consignment from across the border in May 2017, with the assistance of Pakistan-based Rode and PhD, for ISYF module members."}, {"ID": "cHqhM2vXdQJo4LP4k3Uhag", "URL": "https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/idemia-partners-airtel-payments-bank-hmd-global-to-expand-reach-of-digital-rupee/103424829", "Title": "IDEMIA partners Airtel Payments Bank, HMD Global to expand reach of digital Rupee - ET Telecom", "Extract": "Internet 2 min read The organisations aim to work together to launch an \u201cadvanced offline payment system\u201d over the coming months that facilitate the use of the digital Rupee on feature phones with the objective of driving financial inclusion, said IDEMIA on Wednesday. ETTelecom Updated On Sep 6, 2023 at 01:37 PM IST NEW DELHI: Identity technologies and biometric solutions provider IDEMIA has partnered with Airtel Payments Bank and Nokia phone maker HMD Global to expand the reach of offline Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) payments in India. The organisations aim to work together to launch an \u201cadvanced offline payment system\u201d over the coming months that facilitate the use of the digital Rupee on feature phones with the objective of driving financial inclusion, said IDEMIA on Wednesday. The digital Rupee, or eINR, is a tokenised digital version of the Indian currency and it is issued by the Reserve Bank of India as a Central Bank Digital Currency. The Digital Rupee was proposed in January 2017 and its first pilot phase was launched on December 01, 2022. IDEMIA claims that its \u2018Secure Offline CBDC Payment\u2019 solution already works with smartphones, biometric cards, and plastic cards in India. Under this collaboration, IDEMIA's technology will offer an offline layer to ensure instant and secure transactions without the need for online validation. It will work with the digital Rupee in India, and with any other solution, decentralised or centralised, token or account-based, developed in-house by a central bank or independent software vendors. Under the partnership, IDEMIA will pair its CBDC technology with Airtel Payments Bank\u2019s solution and Nokia feature phones to improve financial inclusion. Once the solution is commercially made available, users will be able to pay using an ingenious and cost-effective feature phone extending the accessibility of offline payment functionalities to a wider population. \"Our alliance with Nokia and Airtel Payment Bank is poised to provide valuable insights and contributions to the evolution of offline retail CBDC systems,\u201d said Amit Kakatikar, SVP Payment Solutions at IDEMIA. \u201cOnce this is commercially launched over the next few months, Nokia feature phone users in India, will be able to access the digital Rupee thanks to this collaboration which will empower the Nokia feature phone users with this latest technology and strengthen our government\u2019s vision of inclusive digital economy for all,\u201d said Ravi Kunwar, VP- India & APAC, HMD Global. \"We are confident that once we move from the design phase and launch the solution commercially with all required approvals, it will play a pivotal role in advancing the accessibility of financial services and contribute to India's transition towards a digitally inclusive economy,\" said Prasad Routray, Head, Corporate Business & Alliances at Airtel Payments Bank.

Last month, 40 proposals worth Rs. 5,000 crore were received by the ministry of electronics and IT under the IT Hardware Production Linked Incentive (PLI) 2.0 scheme, although fixed benefit limits mean not all offers will be eligible for the federal monetary support. \u201cEarlier, we kept an investment target of Rs. 2,430 crore in the scheme. But there was an overwhelming response,\u201d joint secretary, ministry of electronics and IT, Amitesh Kumar Sinha, told ET, referring to the 40 proposals indicating fund commitments of Rs. 5,000 crore. \u201cThe amount needed to fund all the proposals will be Rs. 23,000 crore, but the allocated budget is currently Rs. 17,000 crore.\u201d The Centre will have the option to pick and choose projects that qualify for the program, given the overwhelming response. \u201cSo, probably we'll not select everybody. And in case we're not selecting, investments will come slightly lower than Rs. 5,000 crore and investments of about Rs. 4,000 crore may occur,\u201d Sinha said. The proposals have come amid New Delhi\u2019s focus on lowering electronic imports that involved further scrutiny on overseas supplies of computers beyond a stipulated deadline. The six-year PLI scheme for IT hardware\u2014laptops, tablets, all-in-one personal computers, servers, and ultra small form factor devices\u2014aims to attract top hardware companies. PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT hardware was approved in May this year. PLI 1.0 was issued in 2021 with an outlay of Rs 7,350 crore. Semiconductor Manufacturing The government had received three fab proposals and two semiconductor display manufacturing unit proposals. Sinha, also the CEO of the Indian Semiconductor Mission (ISM), said he is \u201cvery hopeful that in one or two years, many (semiconductor) companies will come directly, and we\u2019ll see many more joint ventures too in future.\u201d In the first round, the government could not approve those proposals because they did not meet the required conditions but now the applicants are coming up with revised proposals, he said. After Vedanta and Foxconn parted ways, they both submitted proposals separately. They're trying to meet the necessary conditions needed for approval and it will take some time, Sinha said. Asked why the companies were unable to submit applications that were technologically advanced, Sinha said, \"this sector is very difficult, and the companies are very limited whether it is fab or display technology\". Companies think twice about technology transfer to competitors, he said. \u201cBut some kind of win-win situation can be created\u201d, and Indian companies can create value for global companies, and the latter will see value in supporting local entities. 'Huge Market Potential' This is \"because the market is huge\" and the government is giving a pretty good incentive to attract investments in both semiconductor fab and display, he said. If global companies can start taking some equity in Indian fabs, their JV partners, that will be a win-win situation, he said. Since the ecosystem is not there, the companies always say the number of chemicals, gasses, water and power that is required for these fabs is not available in India, but I don't think this is a concern, he said. \u201cWe have seen the <a href"}, {"ID": "nkqInBp4cVRixvqmjHk1oA", "URL": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/football/aiff-savaged-over-paying-rs-12-15-lakh-to-astrologer-for-inputs-on-team-selection-101694513897997.html", "Title": "\u2018The joke is on us\u2019: AIFF savaged over paying \u2018 \u20b912-15 lakh\u2019 to astrologer for inputs on team selection", "Extract": "Sep 12, 2023 05:19 PM IST As per report, Igor Stimac got in touch with Delhi-NCR based astrologer, who was introduced to the Croatian by former AIFF secretary-general Kushal Das.

Meanwhile, Das said Bhupesh had earlier worked with Bollywood personalities. \u201cThat time, I was worried if India would qualify for the Asian Cup and so was Igor, let me be very honest. It was not a comfortable situation. For me, the most important thing was that India should qualify.

ET Bureau Updated On Sep 29, 2023 at 07:30 AM IST New Delhi: The government is considering a proposal to allow broadband-from-space players such as Jio Satellite Communications, the satcom arm of Reliance Jio , and Bharti Group-backed OneWeb , to provide wireless connectivity to consumers with enabling handsets, officials said. The move to grant mobility services authorisation to Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite Services ( GMPCS ) licence holders will potentially pave the way for companies such as Elon Musk-owned Starlink - which has applied for the licence - to compete with mobile service providers , experts said. An inter-ministerial panel involving the ministries of defence and home affairs, departments of telecommunications and space, and the cabinet secretariat will decide on the matter after security clearance, officials aware of the details told ET. \"The meeting is expected in a couple of weeks,\" one of them said. To be sure, a GMPCS licence already allows mobility services. But the authorisation for such services was held back by DoT when it gave letters of intent (LoI) to OneWeb and Jio Satellite. \"The LoIs issued to OneWeb and Jio are for fixed satellite services,\" a second official said. At that time, there was no device ecosystem and wireless satellite voice and data service could not be demonstrated. But now, the two companies have informed the government that the device ecosystem is starting to build up and it will become more prevalent in the future, officials said. For example, Apple's latest iPhone models support satellite connectivity while chipset companies such as Qualcomm and Mediatek are developing satellite-enabled chipsets. Jio and OneWeb did not reply to emailed queries till press time Thursday. Experts are of the view that while satcom services are currently complementary to terrestrial services, they can in the future compete as technology evolves. A satcom industry executive said that once the technology matures and the networks become interoperable, consumers can get seamless connectivity from satellites. Also, in the future, a subscriber could potentially be unaware if he or she has received a call or message on a terrestrial network or a satcom network, experts said. <a href=\"https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/telecom+regulatory+authority+of+ind"}, {"ID": "hwmoCznXsvRUGMFbXq4eGA", "URL": "https://www.rediff.com/business/report/auto-heavy-industries-ministry-scraps-human-safety-tests-for-ev-batteries/20230907.htm", "Title": "Heavy industries' ministry scraps human safety tests for EV batteries", "Extract": "The Centre on Wednesday scrapped the mandatory human safety tests for electric vehicle (EV) batteries required to qualify for incentives under various government schemes.

Business Standard first reported, on August 1, about the ministry's view to scrapping the mandatory testing parameters.

On April 29, Business Standard first reported about the ministry\u2019s decision to give a six-month deadline extension until October 1. The decision to eliminate the mandatory human safety tests follows the findings of a committee led by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) director. The findings concluded that the MoRTH testing standards are adequate for the present needs of the EV industry. ARAI is a prime testing and certification agency notified by the Government of India. The two nodal ministries \u2014 ministry of heavy industries and MoRTH \u2014 responsible for regulating the transport and EV sectors, announced separate sets of battery safety standards.

The ministry of heavy industries had made human safety tests mandatory to get incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME II) and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for automotive and auto components as well as advanced chemistry cells. The heavy industry ministry\u2019s testing parameters were more stringent than the MoRTH, and required checks at three levels \u2014 the cell, battery management system, and the battery pack. MoRTH\u2019s guidelines were also mandatory for the manufacturing of the vehicles.
