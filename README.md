# Metaphor-Department-Prediction

This repository addresses an open-ended problem statement using the Metaphor API and involves several key components:

Data Collection: The project utilizes the Metaphor API to scrape URLs from the internet. These URLs are sources of web content that will be further analyzed.

Content Scraping: Once the URLs are collected, the system proceeds to scrape the actual content from these web pages. This content can include articles, blog posts, news stories, and more.

Pretrained Model: The project leverages a pretrained machine learning model that is specialized in predicting the relevant Indian government department associated with the scraped content. This prediction is based on the content's context and relevance to government agencies.

Sentiment Analysis: In addition to department prediction, the project also performs sentiment analysis on the scraped content. This analysis assesses the sentiment or emotional tone of the content, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Alert Algorithm: An algorithm can be developed to monitor the sentiment scores of the content. If the sentiment score falls into the negative range, the system can be programmed to notify the specific government department associated with the content. This ensures that government agencies are alerted to potentially negative or critical information that requires their attention.

In summary, this project combines web scraping, machine learning, and sentiment analysis to predict the relevant Indian government department for web content and to monitor sentiment scores. The alert system ensures that negative sentiment content is promptly brought to the attention of the relevant government authorities for appropriate action
